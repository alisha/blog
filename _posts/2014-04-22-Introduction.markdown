Hi everyone! I'm Alisha Ukani, a student at Weston High School. I love molecular biology and computer science.

I'm going to be using this blog to document my work on Global STEM. Global STEM is a non-profit organization I founded to teach STEM skills to underprivileged girls around the world. In February 2015, I'll start it off by teaching a web development class to girls in India.
